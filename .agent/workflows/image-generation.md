## Critical Image Prompt Requirements

When generating images for card art, ALWAYS include these phrases in the prompt:

1. **"full screen view, no frame"** - Prevents the AI from generating framed paintings hanging on walls
2. **"no text, no symbols, no writing, no letters"** - Keeps the image clean for card overlay

## Standard Card Art Prompt Template

```
[Subject description], oil painting in Dutch Golden Age style, [mood/atmosphere], rich warm colors with deep shadows, full screen view, no frame, no text, no symbols, no writing, no letters, painterly brushwork, museum quality fine art
